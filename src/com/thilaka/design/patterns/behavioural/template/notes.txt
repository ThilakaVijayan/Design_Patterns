When we have to set a process flow.

1. use hooks - a concrete method, but it does nothing. subclasses can override it,
but don't have to.
2. template method sits in the abstract class. This method is declared as final,
to avoid subclassess from changing the sequence of steps in the algorithm.
3. This implements the Hollywood principle :)
"Don't call us, we'll call you."
